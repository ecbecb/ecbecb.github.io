<div class="wordwrap">Dedicated to documenting the untold stories of severe mental illness, I am a clinical researcher and journalist investigating psychiatric hospitalization and alternative, non-hospital-based ways of recovery, something I call "guerrilla mental healthcare." <br>
<br>Trieste, Italy, is a pioneer in this, known for being one of the very first cities to deliberately shut down its psychiatric hospital and shift treatment to open-door clinics. From the hospital's void grew increased community acceptance, vocational training and work placements, housing support, and the restitution of human rights for the formerly locked away.</div> 
<br>Illuminating Triestine stories is crucial to preserve such a culture of integration, acceptance, and informal healing. Increased awareness of this model is dire as the suppression of the right to mental health rises globally. As the world learns more about Trieste, new communities will be inspired to rethink how they view mental illness in society.
