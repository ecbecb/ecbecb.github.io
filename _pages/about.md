<div class="wordwrap">Dedicated to documenting the untold stories of severe mental illness, I am a clinical researcher and journalist investigating psychiatric hospitalization and alternative, non-hospital-based ways of recovery, something I call "guerilla mental healthcare." <br>
<br>Trieste, Italy, is a pioneer in this, known for being one of the very first cities to deliberately shut down its psychiatric hospital and shift treatment to open-door clinics. From the hospital's void grew increased community acceptance, vocational training and work placements, housing support, and the restitution of human rights for the formerly locked away.</div> 
<br>Illuminating Triestine stories is crucial to preserve and share awareness on such a culture of integration, acceptance, and informal healing.
