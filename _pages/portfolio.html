<h2>Breaking News</h2>
<div class="wordwrap"> My portfolio of <a href="https://bwog.com/?s=Live+Updates%3A+Gaza+Solidarity+Encampment" 
                        target="_blank">live updates</a> for <i>Bwog</i> about the Columbia Gaza Solidarity Encampments can be found here. 
  </br>
                        </br>Columbia was the first university out of a wave of hundreds to be marked with a sea of tents protesting investment in Israel. Due to media attention, the university quickly shut its gates to all non-affiliates. As a result, myself and other Columbia reporters were the only press permitted to document this historic moment firsthand. 
</br> 
  </br>During this time, us student journalists were under immense media scrutiny. Many were doxed, suspended, or arrested for their duty to report. To protect myself and other writers from these risks, I instituted an anonymity policy for breaking news pieces related to this coverage. For this reason, my name is not attached to these articles.</div> 
  </br>
  </br>Ultimately, our articles and social media posts during this period would go on to receive tens of thousands of views each, and even reached up to 10 million views in select cases.
